## Drum Machine

This is a React app that emulates a drum machine. When a user hits the corresponding key on their keyboard, the drum pad is pressed, an animation is displayed to indicate the triggering, and a drum sample (sound) is played. Additionally, the display bar on the bottom indicates the name of the drum pad being pressed.
